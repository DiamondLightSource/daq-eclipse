/**
 * This service talks to the middleware layer state machine for controlling
 * the scan. If working inside Diamond there is a wiki here:
 * http://confluence.diamond.ac.uk/display/MAP/WP4+Middlelayer+Design+Specification
 * 
 * A version of this design is also in Malcolm.pdf in this package.
 * 
 * The name malcolm is chosen for the middleware layer between the Java OSGi server and
 * the hardware - inspired by the sitcom 'Malcolm in the Middle' 
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_in_the_Middle
 * 
 * This interface attempts to mirror how the hardware in the python looks, hence the
 * fact that it does not look very 'Java'. So instead of setPaused(boolean) we have
 * pause() and resume().
 * 
 * Usage:
 * <code>
 <p>
        IMalcolmService service = ... // OSGi service<br>
        IMalcolmConnection        connection = service.createConnection("tcp://127.0.0.1:7800");<br>
<br>
		IMalcolmDevice zebra =  connection.getDevice("zebra");<br>
	    Map<String, Object> config = new HashMap<String,Object>(2);<br>
		config.put("PC_BIT_CAP", 1);<br>
		config.put("PC_TSPRE", "ms");<br>
		<br>
		zebra.configure(config);<br>
		zebra.run(); // blocks until finished<br>
		<br>
		final State state = zebra.getState();<br>
        // ... We did something!<br>
</p>        
</code>
