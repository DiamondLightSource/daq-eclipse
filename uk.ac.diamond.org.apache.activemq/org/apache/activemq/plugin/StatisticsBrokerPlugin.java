 * A StatisticsBrokerPlugin

 * To retrieve stats on the broker send a empty message to ActiveMQ.Statistics.Broker (Queue or Topic)
 * With a replyTo set to the destination you want the stats returned to.
 * To retrieve stats for a destination - e.g. foo - send an empty message to ActiveMQ.Statistics.Destination.foo
 * - this works with wildcards to - you get a message for each wildcard match on the replyTo destination.
