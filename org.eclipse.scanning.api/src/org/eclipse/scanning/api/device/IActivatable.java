/**
 * 
 * An interface for devices that are activatable and part of the scan.
 * For runnable devices (detectors etc) they get included as detectors,
 * for scannables activated scannables are included as monitors.
 * 
 * This is normally used to mark detectors as being active so that if 
 * scan algorithm data is contstructed they will be included in the scan.
 * 
 * NOTE: Normally the scan device is told specifically which detectors to use
 * it does not take into account the isActivated() value when the scan is run.
 * Instead this is used when the scan data is being constructed. 
 * 
 * Activated devices are used when a scan is constructed and the state is saved.
 * This allows devices created in Spring to be activated and therefore run in 
 * a default scan. However the actual devices run in the scan are just defaulted
 * to those activated. It is perfectly possible to run non-activated devices
 * by putting them in the scan request.
