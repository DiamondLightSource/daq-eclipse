/**
 * 
 * A device controller takes input from several clients
 * and ensures that each of their preferences about pausing
 * the device being controlled is taken into account.
 * 
 * For instance three classes control a scan, a class from the
 * user interface, one from the topup monitor and one from the
 * beam stop monitor, call them gui, topup, shutter
 * 
 * If any one of gui, topup, shutter pause, the device gets paused.
 * If all of gui, topup and shutter say resume, the device gets resumed.
 * 
 * gui, topup and shutter have an id that goes in a map. They must always
 * use the same id to send commands to the controller or it will not work.
