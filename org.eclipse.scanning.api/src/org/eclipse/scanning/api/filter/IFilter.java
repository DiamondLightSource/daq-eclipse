/**
 * <h3> Filters </h3>
 * Filters work as follows:<p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * L = list of things to be filtered
 * e = excluded function
 * i = included function
 * l = filtered list.
 * <p>
 *   l = L-e(L)+i(L)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This means that all combinations are possible.
 * An exclude of .* may be applied if only particular devices
 * are required in the filter and everything done with includes.
 * A particular set of devices may be removed but if one is
 * required, it may be added back in with the final include.
