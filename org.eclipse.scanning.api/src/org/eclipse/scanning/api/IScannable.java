/**
 * 
 * Something that can take part in a sequenced scan which can have its position set.
 * 
 * This scannable is inspired by the original GDA8 Scannable. Very approximately Scannable
 * is IScannable<Object>. Some methods have be changed because the original Scannable had
 * some stale design. For instance IScanable has one setPosition which is blocking until 
 * it has moved. Also it is possible to set position knowing where the demand values of
 * other scannables are. This is important so that during a scan, each scannable when it is
 * told to move, has available all the other moves at that IPosition in the scan.
 * 
 * Important note - please do not extend this interface, it must be kept simple. In GDA9 extra
 * methods such as scanStart() etc. are dealt with by annotations. The idea is to have core
 * functionality as interface declarations and optional extensions as annotated methods.
 * See @ScanStart @ScanEnd @ScanFinally @ScanFault @ScanAbort etc.
