 * This is a good idea when the iterator checks an moves hardware for each point.
 * Ideally the hardware should all be moved by the scanning and the iterator return the
 * list of precalculated point but in some instances it is desirable to calculate the
 * next position based on where the last position got to. In this case all points
 * cannot be interated until they are run and you must implement this interface to 
 * provide extra scan information such that no points have to be looked at until the scan
 * runs.
