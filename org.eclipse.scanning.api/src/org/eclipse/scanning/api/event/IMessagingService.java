 * This service allows messaging to be started and stopped on localhost.
 * 
 * It means that users do not have to start a manual activemq instance when
 * debugging the server. It might also mean that activemq can be run in the 
 * Acqusition Server, however this is not usually desirable because the point
 * of the messaging service it that it exists in a separate process which 
 * keeps state of queues even when consumers are restarted.
