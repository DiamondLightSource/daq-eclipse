/**
 * 
 * A poster broadcasts a request of an object with a unique id.
 * The server then fills in information about this object and
 * broadcasts it back. The UUID must be set to determine which
 * response belongs with whcih request. 
 * <p>
 * This mimics web server functionality but uses the existing
 * messaging system without requiring a web server configuration.
 * An alternative to this might be to start a jetty server on
 * the acquisition server and response to requests directly.
 * <p>
 * A use case for this is where a client would like to get a list
 * of detectors. NOTE: Unlike a web server this paradigm allows
 * multiple responders to reply on a topic. Therefore for instance
 * if many malcolm devices are available on different ports, a post
 * will be made asking for those devices and the response from many
 * listeners of the post topic collated.
 * <p>
 * @param T You <b>must</b> override the merge(...) method in your type. This
 * puts the reponder's information into your bean. In the case where there
 * are multiple reponders (like a list of detectors) you must be additive
 * in the merge method.
 * <p>
