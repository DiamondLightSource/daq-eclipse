/**
 * <p>
 * This interface is designed to make it easy to listen to all events and easy
 * to listen to a specific scan.
 * </p>
 * <b>Listen to all events:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * IEventService service = ...
 * IScanSubscriber sub = service.createSubscriber(...)
 * IScanListener listener = new IScanListener() {
 * 		{@literal @}Override
 * 		public void scanEventPerformed(ScanEvent evt) {
 * 		// Everything that happens ...
 * 		}
 * 	};
 * sub.addScanListener(listener);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <b>Listen to specific events for a given scan:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * IScanListener listener2 = new IScanListener() {
 * 		{@literal @}Override
 * 		public void scanEventPerformed(ScanEvent evt) {
 * 		// Everything that happens ...
 *  		}
 * sub.addScanListener(<b>id</b>, listener2);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * NOTE: If a listener is registered it will then be associated with the scan it
 * is registered with only. It should be unregistered and readded. So for
 * instance:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code sub.addScanListener(id, listener); // registers for id but removes it as general listener.}
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Removes the Object listener from the general listeners and defines it as a
 * listener of the id. This listener would have to be readded using
 * {@code addScanListener(listener)} to use it again as a general listener.
