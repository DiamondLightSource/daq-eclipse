 * 
 * Two types of queue may be created, started, stopped or destroyed:
 * - job-queue - acting on {@link QueueBean}s
 * - active-queue - acting on {@link QueueAtom}s
 * 
 * The job-queue is treated as a top-level queue - there should only be one 
 * created per IQueueService instance. The active-queue is where the actual 
 * experiment processing should be done; as such there can be any number of 
 * these in parent-child relationships, with the job-queue at the root of the 
 * tree.
