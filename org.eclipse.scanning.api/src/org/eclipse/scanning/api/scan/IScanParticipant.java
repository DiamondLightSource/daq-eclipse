/**
 * 
 * Any class wishing to have annotated methods called during
 * a scan may implement this interface and then either:
 *  <p>
 * &bull; 1. Register the class with IRunnableDeviceService.register(IScanParticipant) <br>
 * &bull; 2. Export the class as an OSGi service. The annotation manager will look for any service <br>
 * implementing IScanParticipant
 *  <p>
 * The Scanning System will get all objects declared as implementing
 * this interface from OSGi and include the devices in the scan.
 * Any methods then implemented in the device will be called where they
 * are annotated as the scan expects.
 *  <p>
 * One example of this is archiving. The archiver implements IScanParticipant
 * and is then included in the scan. As the files are declared as being part
 * of the scan, the @FileDeclared annotation is called, at the end of the
 * scan @ScanEnd is called, finally @ScanFinally is called to close any resources
 * or reset the file list because there is no more a scan!
 * <p>
 * 
 * An example of the IScanParticipant is the FileRegistrar for archiving in GDA
 * This has a register method which gets the IScanService and adds the FileRegistrar
 * as an IScanParticipant. The annotations in FileRegistrar are then parsed and it
 * does the archiving.
