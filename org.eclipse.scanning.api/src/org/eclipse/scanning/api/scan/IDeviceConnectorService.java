/**
 * Clients do not need to consume this service, it is used to provide connection
 * to devices which already exist, like those in GDA8.
 * <p>
 * A bundle implements this service and the scanning consumes the service. The
 * tests provide the service directly.
 * <p>
 * This service is designed to be implemented by GDA8 to provide scannables
 * (existing ones) to the new system. This can be done easily as
 * {@link IScannable} is a subset of Scannable in GDA8.
 * <p>
 * It also provides {@link IWritableDetector}'s. These are analogous to, but not
 * the same as Detector in GDA. The service wraps both gda.device.Detector into
 * {@link IWritableDetector} and gda.px.detector.Detector into
 * {@link IWritableDetector}. In the first case the model provides the
 * collection time and anything else required. In the later case the model
 * provides the file path and omegaStart required.
 * <p>
 * It mirrors the other connector services like the JMS one, which push the
 * details of getting connections outside the core scanning API using
 * declarative services.
