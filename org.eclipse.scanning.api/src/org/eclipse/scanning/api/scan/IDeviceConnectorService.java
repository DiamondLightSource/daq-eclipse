/**
 * 
 * Clients do not need to consume this service, it is used
 * to provide connection to devices which already exist, like those in GFA8.
 * 
 * A bundle implements this service and the scanning
 * consumes the service. The tests provide the service
 * directly.
 * 
 * This service is designed to be implemented by GDA8 to 
 * provide scannables (existing ones) to the new system.
 * This can be done easily as IScannable is a subset of
 * Scannable in GDA8.
 * 
 * It also provides IDetectors. These are not analogous but
 * not the same as Detector in GDA. The service wraps both gda.device.Detector
 * into IReadableDetector and gda.px.detector.Detector into IScanner. In the
 * first case the model provides the collection time and anything else required.
 * In the later case the model provides the file path and omegaStart required.
 * 
 * It mirrors the other connector services like the jms one,
 * which push the details of getting connections outside the
 * core scanning API using declarative services.
