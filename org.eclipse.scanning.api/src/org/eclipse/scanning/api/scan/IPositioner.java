 * This class deals with setting the beamline to a specific position.

pos.setPosition(new MapPosition("x:1, y:2"));

//'sservice' is the scanning service.  setPosition moves the motors to their positions by level until they are all there and then returns. It is the same thing as used to move to a scan point during a scan. 
//The MapPosition is just a convenience for Java. 
//In Jython since the MapPosition also takes a map, a dictionary can be used:

pos.setPosition(new MapPosition({'x':1, 'y':2}));
// returns after the position is reached moving the motors based on level, lowest first.
