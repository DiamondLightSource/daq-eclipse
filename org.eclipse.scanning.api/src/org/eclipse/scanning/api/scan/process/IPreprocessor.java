A computer program that modifies data to conform with the input requirements of another program.

 * A preprocessor which makes a ScanRequest into one which matches the available hardware for a given beamline.

 * Preprocessors can be registered as OSGi services (perhaps in Spring config files, using the OSGiServiceRegister
 * class) and will then be used by the ScanServlet to process scan requests before they are run.
