	 * action. Many devices have one type of stop, therefore in their
	 * cases the preference to panic or controlled (etc) is treated as
	 * aspiration rather than reality i.e. ignored.

	 * <p>Important: This call is blocking, it does not only set a flag to 
	 * stop the move and return but it blocks until we are done moving! For instance
	 * it uses a CountDownLatch which is started on the move and released
	 * whenever the move is exited.
