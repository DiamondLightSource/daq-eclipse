/**
 * 
 * TODO FIXME - Do something better than this for remote services! Need help from
 * Data Acquisition Team on this subject.
 * 
 * It is not clear how to do remote OSGi services that work on any code base, python, javascript etc.
 * 
 * Rather than adopt a specific technology like the equinox OSGi services, it was decided
 * to make certain services have remote implementations. This is a temporary measure which 
 * if it works and is maintainable might be a supportable long term solution. However if
 * is is hard to maintain, the getRemoteService(...) call in IEventService could be replaced
 * with a call to get the full remote OSGi service. Point being this approach can be edited to
 * gracefully support something other than hand coding each remote service in the future.
 * 
 * Problems:
 * 1. Some services will actually materialize from OSGi on the client but will not be remote
 * this could be confusing.
 * 2. Inelegant design that needs work done for each new service added, we have seen how
 * poor this is this GDA CORBA. We should not repeat the same mistakes.
 * 
 * Advantages:
 * 1. Client technologies other than Java like python and javascript are possible. They would 
 * need an equivalent of RemoteServiceFactory probably to make the remote servers.
 * 2. This is a full asynchronous model using messaging. The client does not have a static endpoint.
 * For instance as far as the client is concerned the devices in the device service are all connectable
 * to and controllable, however they may be implemented on separate hardware. For instance a detector
 * could register itself from python/stomp and the client would still pick it up and make it available.
 * This complete abstraction can be advantageous in theory for facilities like DLS.
