 * 
 * A Java servlet is a Java program that extends the capabilities of a server.
 * Although servlets can respond to any types of requests, they most commonly 
 * implement applications hosted on Web servers.[1] Such Web servlets are the
 * Java counterpart to other dynamic Web content technologies such as PHP and ASP.NET.

 * 
 * This package deals with actions which the acquisition server may be instructed to do.
 * It defines the interface of the server to various client types, Java, VB and javascript.
